Technical Support Analysis Dashboard - Project Description
Project Overview:
This project is a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize data related to technical support tickets. The dashboard tracks key metrics such as ticket resolution times, agent performance, and trends in customer issues. It helps stakeholders (managers and team leaders) identify patterns in technical support requests and optimize performance for better customer satisfaction.

Technologies Used:

Power BI: For creating the interactive dashboard and visualizations.
SQL (or Excel) for data extraction and preparation.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create measures and calculated columns.
Power Query: For cleaning and transforming the raw data into a structured format.
Project Features:

Ticket Resolution Time: Analyzed to show how quickly issues are resolved and to identify any bottlenecks in the resolution process.
Agent Performance Metrics: A comparison of agentsâ€™ resolution times, the number of tickets handled, and customer feedback.
Ticket Trends: A breakdown of issues by category (e.g., software, hardware, connectivity) to identify recurring problems or areas needing improvement.
Customer Feedback: Visualizations based on customer feedback to measure satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement.
Key Insights:

Resolution Time: 80% of tickets were resolved within 24 hours, but a small percentage took over 72 hours, highlighting an area for improvement.
Agent Performance: One agent, John Doe, consistently had the fastest resolution times, while others could benefit from additional training or support.
Ticket Trends: The most common issues were related to "Software Installation," indicating a need for better documentation or automated solutions in that area.
Impact and Value:

Improved Efficiency: By identifying patterns in ticket resolution, the support team can prioritize issues and reduce response times.
Optimized Training: The agent performance metrics help pinpoint areas where certain team members may need further training.
Better Decision Making: The dashboard provides actionable insights, helping managers make data-driven decisions about staffing and resource allocation.
